# End of Year's project
This project is mainly a challenge of mine to get into developping and planning a strategy RPG game (a la Valkyria Chronicles).

This game contains a Finite State Machine to deal with game states, character stat classes, a preLoad scene where it contains a static singleton script to deal with various game components shared between all scenes in a single script. (See the Music.cs script for managing all music in game with one script)

Design is a low poly model with flat coloring.
